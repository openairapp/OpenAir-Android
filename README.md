3. Create a file in the git root named `local.properties` and add the maps API key `MAPS_API_KEY=XXXXX`
4. Connect your device with usb
5. Build and install the apk `./gradlew installDebug`



## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

[Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) is recommended, you'll probably want to generate and add a maps API key as specified in the installation instructions.

[Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.]::
